# @webprotocol/nwep

Node.js bindings for quiche-nwep - A QUIC/HTTP/3/NWEP implementation.

## Installation

**Important:** This package must be built from within the quiche-nwep workspace. It cannot be installed standalone via npm.

### From the quiche-nwep repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/usenwep/quiche-nwep.git
cd quiche-nwep

# Navigate to the node package
cd node

# Install dependencies and build
npm install
```

The build process will automatically compile the native Rust bindings for your platform.

## Requirements

- **Rust** 1.85+ ([install from rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Node.js** 12.22+ / 14.17+ / 15.12+ / 16.0+
- **Build tools**:
  - Linux: `build-essential`, `cmake`, `perl`
  - macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools or MinGW-w64

## Usage

```javascript
const nwep = require('@webprotocol/nwep')

// Your code here
```

## Building

```bash
# Build the native addon
npm run build

# Build in debug mode
npm run build:debug
```

The build script automatically:
- Detects your current platform (Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.)
- Checks for Rust installation
- Compiles the native addon using napi-rs
- Places the compiled `.node` file in the package directory

## Development

This package is part of the quiche-nwep workspace and depends on several workspace crates:
- `quiche` - Core QUIC/HTTP/3 implementation
- `octets` - Buffer manipulation
- `qlog` - QUIC logging
- And other workspace dependencies

All dependencies are resolved through the workspace, which is why standalone installation is not supported.

## Architecture

The package provides Node.js bindings to the Rust quiche library using [napi-rs](https://napi.rs/), enabling:
- High-performance QUIC connections
- HTTP/3 support
- NWEP protocol support
- Native speed with JavaScript convenience
